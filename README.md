# Swiggy Analytics Dashboard üìä

A visually rich and interactive **Power BI dashboard** built to analyze Swiggy's business performance using data-driven insights. This project covers key metrics such as revenue, customer behavior, restaurant performance, and customer ratings.

## üîç Project Overview

This dashboard was created to simulate a real-world business intelligence solution for a leading food delivery platform like **Swiggy**. It helps stakeholders make strategic decisions by offering a comprehensive view of:

- Revenue generation by city and date
- Order distribution and volume
- Restaurant performance and dish popularity
- Customer satisfaction based on ratings and reviews
- Delivery partner insights

The project demonstrates my proficiency in **Power BI**, **data modeling**, **DAX**, and **data visualization** techniques.

## üìÇ Dataset Details

The analysis is based on the following `.csv` files:

| File Name              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `customers.csv`        | Contains customer demographic and ID details |
| `delivery_partners.csv`| Contains delivery partner IDs and related info |
| `Orders.csv`           | Main transactional data of orders placed |
| `restaurants.csv`      | Restaurant details like ID, name, city, and ratings |

These datasets were cleaned, transformed, and loaded using Power Query and modeled efficiently in Power BI.
